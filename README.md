- 👋 Hi, I’m @dinzinz
- 👀 I’m pretty curious about many things. If you know something about MBTI — I have INTP-A Type, 5w4, so/sx 🧐 Quite interested in psychology and digital art 
- ⚠️ Also I have Asperger's Syndrome. I think I should let you know it. So it'll be desirable if my future place of work will be calm and with written instructions
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and HTML. I'm beginner, you know... Re-e-ea-a-ally beginner. But I love studying so it will change ❤️
- My english is ridiculous, because I can read english texts pretty good, but can be bad at grammar. I can watch series almost w/o subtitles (even the english ones), but my spelling... Typical problem for language learners, huh?
